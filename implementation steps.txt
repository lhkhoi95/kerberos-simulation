1. User authentication: The user logs in with their credentials (username and password) to their local workstation or client device.

2. Request for a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT): The client sends a request to the Kerberos authentication server, 
known as the Key Distribution Center (KDC), for a TGT.

3. TGT generation: The KDC checks the user's credentials against its database and if the credentials are valid, 
generates a TGT for the user. The TGT is encrypted with a secret key that is shared between the KDC and the client device.

4. TGT transmission: The KDC sends the encrypted TGT back to the client device.

5. TGT decryption: The client device decrypts the TGT using the shared secret key.

6.TGT storage: The TGT is stored in the client device's memory and is used to request service tickets from 
the KDC without prompting the user for their password again.

7. Service ticket request: When the user wants to access a specific network resource, such as a file server, 
the client sends a request to the KDC for a service ticket.

8. Service ticket generation: The KDC generates a service ticket, which is encrypted with a secret key that 
is shared between the KDC and the resource server.

9. Service ticket transmission: The KDC sends the encrypted service ticket back to the client device.

10. Service ticket decryption: The client device decrypts the service ticket using the TGT stored in its memory.

11. Service ticket transmission to the server: The client device sends the decrypted service ticket to the resource server.

12. Service ticket validation: The resource server validates the service ticket by decrypting it using its shared secret key with the KDC. 
If the ticket is valid, the resource server grants the user access to the requested resource.
